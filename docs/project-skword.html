        <p>SKword is a creative design firm in Japan of around 70 people. Their existing way of running projects was mostly waterfall and task-based, managed through Gantt charts. This approach made it difficult to respond to clients’ emerging and ambiguous messages, or to hold space for exploration as those messages evolved. At the same time, the firm wanted more members who could independently manage and produce projects, rather than relying on a few key individuals.</p>
        <p>This project began as a change initiative led in partnership with the CEO, who had been a participant in my 8-week project management bootcamp. Our shared aim was to redesign project practice so that SKword could respond more flexibly to client needs and grow internal project capability across the team.</p>
